# MockProject aka Project M
it's for helping to test my private GateKeeper

## Example of unit test and integration test with Services
# app.facebook - unit test
# app.google - unit test
# services.screening - integration test



```
python -m unittest
```

no need to setup any venv because the code uses all default package from python 3.10
